Last week community developer Hash512 (on Discord) achieved a major milestone with the launch of the NavCoin m8 staking device. We covered its specs in detail in last week’s NavCoin Community News, and now it’s available for sale through the NavCoin m8 website. This is the culmination of many months hard work, and is another example of the amazing things can be achieved by the NavCoin community. Get your NavCoin m8 here:

You can get in touch with Hash512 via the m8 Discord channel. Maybe there’s something you could do to help out?

To show his support for the NavCoin m8 project Beekart created this banner.

### Developer Updates

As part of the development of the NavCoin m8, Hash512 has been working with community member Sakdeniz. They have just completed testing Sakdeniz’ NEXT wallet on NavCoin m8, running a mix of 32-bit and 64-bit daemons for NavCoin and several more coins. What’s more, the Nexus QT wallet is likely to be confirmed as a supported wallet on NavCoin m8 later this week.

The people behind the NavCoin Telegram Bot have announced the first hot/atomic swaps on Telegram. Now you can exchange NAV-BTC, NAV-LTC and a range of other currencies all within Telegram itself. Here’s their announcement:

Community developer BuckoNZ is building an Odroid stakebox for NavCoin. He reports that he has performed four key tests to determine whether the NavCoin Core build on the Odroid XU4 is working correctly, and all four tests were successful. More details of this project can be found in this thread on the Odroid Forums:

Work continued on rolling out the refreshed NavCoin.org website. Once pages are revised or new pages are built they will go live, so make sure to keep an eye out for them. The objective is to make NavCoin.org a more effective resource for developers in the community by providing the tools and support they need to build their own projects.

Craig has started working on his NavCoin Protocol lmprovement Proposal (NPIP004) - the static reward implementation, which is intended to shift NavCoin towards being compliant to the Proof of Stake v3 protocol. You can read Craig’s thoughts on why it’s important here:

Because implementing this NPIP will require a consensus change, it will be subject to extensive discussion and testing, before it’s put up for a vote by the network.

### Core Content Creators

The Content Creators have been working closely with Core Developers on refreshing NavCoin.org to ensure that they have the content they need. Alongside that, they’ve been preparing video content for NavCoin.org, NavCoin OpenAlias and the Community Fund. A PR plan is in the works for the Community Fund too. It’s the world’s first dual vote fund, so it’s important that journalists have the information they need to produce accurate articles about this unique initiative.

As always, creating social media was a key part of the week’s work. Posts were created for the Community Fund and NavCoin OpenAlias. They are highlights of the NavCoin ecosystem and will be an ongoing presence on social to ensure as many people as possible hear about them and get involved.

The Community Fund is still under testing, but NavCoin OpenAlias registrations are open now. Have you claimed your NavName yet? It’s easy and only takes a moment.

That’s all for this week,

NavCoin Core
