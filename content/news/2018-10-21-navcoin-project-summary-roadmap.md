With open source and decentralised projects, sometimes it's hard to see the whole landscape at a glance. To help consolidate the NavCoin community's past achievements and future vision, I've put together a PDF document which outlines a high level overview of the NavCoin project and where the technology is heading.

With open source and decentralised projects, sometimes it's hard to see the whole landscape at a glance. To help consolidate the NavCoin community's past achievements and future vision, I've put together a PDF document which outlines a high level overview of the NavCoin project and where the technology is heading.

Feel free to use this as a resource and publish it wherever you think it's appropriate.

Here's an excerpt from the document:

> NavCoin is a community driven project with many contributors so the possibilities are truly endless. When the Community Fund is activated the only limit will be your imagination.
>
> Everyone has unrestricted autonomy when it comes to building software or services that utilise
> NavCoin online or in the real world. The community works together as willing participants in this
> new economy to create a better future.
