This is an exciting day for everyone in the NavCoin community. [NavCoin Core 4.4.0 has been released](https://navcoin.org/wallets/). What’s most significant about the latest version of NavCoin Core is that it allows for the activation of the NavCoin Community Fund.  

This is an exciting day for everyone in the NavCoin community. [NavCoin Core 4.4.0 has been released](https://navcoin.org/wallets/). What’s most significant about the latest version of NavCoin Core is that it allows for the activation of the NavCoin Community Fund.  

The NavCoin Community Fund is the first in the world to be fully decentralized, both in the way it’s governed and how the funds are managed. Without the participation of many people within the global NavCoin community, it would not have been possible. The NavCoin Core team would like to thank everyone who contributed their time and skill to bring it to life.

### Download NavCoin Core 4.4.0

With the release of the 4.4.0 wallet, the NavCoin Community Fund soft-fork will lock in once it has reached a 75% network consensus. To signal your approval[ download the latest version of the NavCoin Core wallet](https://navcoin.org/wallets/), at NavCoin.org

Once consensus is reached there will be a one week lock-in period, and after that, the Fund will be activated, and open to submissions. 

You will be able to submit your proposal using the built-in proposal form in [the latest version of the NEXT wallet](http://next.navcommunity.net/), or via RPC commands in the NavCoin Core wallet (for details [check out the knowledge base article](https://info.navcoin.org/knowledge-base/creating-a-community-fund-proposal/)). 

It’s anticipated that [the NavCoin block explorer](https://www.navexplorer.com/) will also include a proposal generator tool in the future.

Look out for an announcement in social media when the lock-in of NavCoin Core 4.4.0 is achieved.

### Education live streaming session #3

Last week Craig presented the third in the series of live-streamed public education sessions, which focused on the Community Fund. If you weren’t able to make the live stream, don’t worry, you can still watch it on [NavCoin’s Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjDs4JceVSsaeCyvkA9cWCg), along with the first two live streams and other NavCoin videos. There will be more live streamed sessions in the future. Look out for updates here and [in social media](https://twitter.com/NavCoin?lang=en).

### NavCoin summary document

With so many different projects going on it’s easy to lose sight of the big picture. With that in mind, Craig put together this [project summary document](https://navhub.org/news/2018-10-21-navcoin-project-summary-roadmap/) for a high-level view of where NavCoin is heading. This is a great document to share with people new to the NavCoin community.

### NavCollab highlight: Nav Art space
