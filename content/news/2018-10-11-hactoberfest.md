Navcoin is participating in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) - what is that you ask? Well its annual celebration of all things open source, Hacktoberfest launched as a partnership between DigitalOcean and GitHub in 2014 and rallies a global community of contributors, with last year’s event drawing nearly 240K pull requests.

This year it will be the fifth instalment. During this one-month hackathon, you can support open-source and by participating you can earn a limited edition swag.

The idea is simple, to get a shirt, you must make five pull requests (PRs) between October 1–31 in any timezone. PRs can be to any public repo on GitHub and must contain commits you made yourself.  This year, there are 50,000 T-shirts up for grabs.

We here at NavCoin want you to help you get that swag and have added the label Hacktoberfest to the issues in our repos that might be a good starting point for anyone wanting to get involved.
