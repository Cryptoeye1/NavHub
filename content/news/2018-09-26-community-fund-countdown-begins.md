After months of development, testing and re-testing, the NavCoin Community Fund is almost ready to go live. With only a little while longer to wait, it’s a good time to get to thinking about how you could utilise the Community Fund - such as what types of projects you would like to see funded. Feel free to share your thoughts on Discord, and see if others agree!

## Developer News

### Website redesign

The redesign of NavCoin.org is finished and will be live in the next week. A refreshed roadmap is also part of this project and aims to help tidy up how the roadmap is currently presented. Instead of having a single roadmap with both protocol & community projects combined into one, there will be a roadmap for protocol development on the navcoin.org website, and a roadmap for layer 2 community projects on navhub.org.

### Community Fund bug bounty

With 250,000 NAV accumulating in the Community Fund every year security is extremely important and testing has absorbed hundreds of hours of Core Developer time. The wider community also made a significant contribution. The 20,000 NAV Bug Bounty was created to incentivize community members to try and break the Fund, and two bounties were paid out to community members who identified bugs. If you reviewed the code, the Core Developers appreciate your help with this project, and encourage you to keeping reviewing and contributing to the NavCoin code base.

### Community Fund proposal and voting tool

This is a simple form that can be embedded into other websites to enable users to easily create and vote for NavCoin Community Fund proposals. It automatically generates the console commands for you to enter into your NavCoin wallet, so you don’t need to know how to write them yourself. This tool is still being refined, but if you’d like to review the code now, it’s available now on Github.

## Community Contributors

Beekart has been busy adding to his amazing NavCoin artwork series. To see his latest creations head over to Twitter and follow him [@Rogiervdbeek](https://twitter.com/rogiervdbeek?lang=en).

Also busy this week was Chasethechaser (on Discord) who utilised some of Beekart’s work to make this infographic for the Community Fund soft-fork. Despite having no prior experience with Photoshop or Illustrator, chasethechaser simply watched some Youtube tutorials and learned on the job.

## Core Content Creators

The Community Fund ‘inspirational video’ for social media channels and the NavCoin.org home page videos are both in production. The creative team met with the film crew this week to plan the shoot and scout locations for filming. The next step is casting the ‘talent.’ The aim is to find a diverse range of people to reflect wide variety of people who make up the NavCoin community all over the world. The shoot is scheduled in the next few weeks and you can expect to see the finished videos in late October.

That’s all for this week,

NavCoin Core
