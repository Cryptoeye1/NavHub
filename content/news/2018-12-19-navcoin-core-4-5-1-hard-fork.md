Welcome to the last NavCoin Community News of 2018. The big news this week is the release of the NavCoin 4.5.1 hard fork, which fixes an issue in the Community Fund discovered by community member Prodpeak (on Discord).

Updating your NavCoin Core wallet to the new version before 00.00AM GMT on 21 December is very important to avoid disruption to the network. Craig has [written a notice](https://navcoin.org/en/notices/2018-12-17-navcoin-4-5-1-hard-fork) detailing this update in NavCoin.org and the [release notes](https://github.com/NAVCoin/navcoin-core/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-4.5.1.md) are available on Github. 

If you’re running a NavPi it should auto-update within 24 hours, but you will still need to login to complete the update procedure and restart.

### First Community Fund proposals accepted by the network

At the time of writing eight proposals have already been accepted by the network. Head over to [NavExplorer](https://www.navexplorer.com/community-fund/proposals/accepted), where you’ll see what each of the proposals is about, the funds requested by the project teams, and their expected duration. 

With 500,000 NAV available every year, it’s definitely worth doing some brainstorming and making your own submissions to the Community Fund. The [Collab site ](https://collab.navcoin.org/dashboard)and NavCoin on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NavCoin/) are good places to start. You’ll see what other community members are proposing and you can join in the discussion.

### A new NavPi Community Fund UI

Here’s a great initiative by community member Siflu (on Discord) - a new user interface for the NavPi. The current UI involves copying and pasting console commands, which isn’t an ideal user experience. Siflu’s version provides a much more elegant solution, where you just need to click buttons. You can see Siflu’s [simple and intuitive new interface](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/416000381605249024/524382113886109696/unknown.png) here.

### Coingecko Beam notifications

As a reminder - NavCoin is now part of [Coingecko’s Beam alert service](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/navcoin/status_updates#panel), which is similar to Blockfolio Signal. It’s another easy way for you to get news about projects you have on your portfolio tracker.

### A small recap of a big year

This year was massive for the NavCoin community, with constant development and new product launches. The NavCoin core protocol went from version 4.1.0 to 4.5.1 - and introduced Open Alias, the clock synch fix, static rewards & cold staking soft forks, and more. 

The world’s first fully decentralised Community Fund started accumulating funds and was activated after months of building & testing. A whole range of projects have been built by our community developers - from the NavCoin M8 stakebox, to the NEXT wallet. Beekart has been a creative force with his NAV themed art and Nio signed up a host of new retailers in Italy. New translations of NavCoin documentation were added, community social channels have been set up, and NavCoin.org was refreshed with a new look and a lot of new content. But most importantly, we’ve come together as a community - with more and more community members getting involved and helping out. There is no shortage of people we could thank.

### Get a Collab profile for Christmas

If you have a spare moment over the holiday season why not [register and make your profile](https://collab.navcoin.org/dashboard) at the NavCoin Collab site. After that, you’ll be able to post your own Community Fund project ideas and give other community members a helping hand with theirs. Remember you don’t need to be a blockchain expert to get involved. To succeed many projects will need a range of different skills - and you might be pleasantly surprised to find that your skills are just what other community members need to complete their project team.
