NavCoin 4.4.0 is now [ready for you to download at NavCoin.org](https://navcoin.org/wallets/). It’s most exciting feature is the new NavCoin Community Fund. Now there’s a unique opportunity for anyone in NavCoin’s thriving global community to create projects and get paid for their work. 

With 250,000 NAV accumulating in the fund each year - it’s the perfect time for you to get involved and contribute your skills to an inclusive community of developers, entrepreneurs and technologists.

### The world’s first fully-decentralised community fund

The NavCoin Community Fund is the world’s most advanced fund. It improves on the way traditional way community development funds work in three important ways.

1. Fully decentralised. It’s not controlled or managed by any individual or single group, and the funds are generated by the network itself. Once it gets going, nothing can stop it.
2. Unique dual voting process. Projects are approved for funding and payment using a two-stage vote. The first round is to accept or reject proposals, and the second is to release payment when approved projects are complete. This ensures that people only get paid if they deliver what they promised to do - giving them an incentive to following their projects through, and to protect the funds from scammers.
3. There are no rules for what can be proposed. The subject of the proposal is entirely up to the individual who submits it. All it needs is a 75% YES vote from the network to be accepted.

### Soft fork lock-in period

Because this is a soft fork it will take some time for a majority of NavCoin stakers (75%) to start signalling their acceptance by downloading the latest version of the NavCoin Core wallet. Once stakers using the latest version reaches the 75% mark there will be a one-week stand-down period to give the remaining stakers time to upgrade. When the soft fork is locked-in, users will then be able to submit proposals to the NavCoin Community Fund. You can view the progress of the soft fork using the NavExplorer.

Over the next few weeks, we will be releasing more content about the NavCoin Community Fund and its unique features. There will be articles, videos and social posts that will raise public awareness of the Fund, as well as helping you use tools that have been developed to assist community members with submitting high-quality proposals.
