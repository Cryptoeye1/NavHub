### Live Stream Education Sessions

Starting on September 13, NavCoin Core public education sessions will be streamed live so international members of the NavCoin community can sit in. These occasional sessions will cover a range of topics that are relevant to anyone who’s interested in NavCoin and blockchain. 

The first one will be held next Thursday at 0830 GMT +12 and will cover the NavCoin Protocol Improvement Proposals (NPIP's) for Static Rewards and Cold Staking. After the session, the videos will remain on Youtube, so you can watch them at your leisure. Stay tuned for more details.

## Developer Updates

### NPIPs

Prole has finished coding his Static Block Reward proposal NPIP004. Head over to GitHub and check it out.

If you’d like to get involved in testing NPIP004, the binaries and testing notes will be available on GitHub after the Community Fund and Collab website projects have gone live.

### Websites

Work continued on the Community Fund Collab website. It has been migrated to AWS from the development server, content is being added, and the new design style is being applied across the site.

Several PR's for NavHub.org and NavCoin.org sites were reviewed, and time was spent on the roll-out of the refreshed NavCoin.org.

The metadata on the NavCoin OpenAlias website is in the process of being optimised, page by page, to ensure it displays properly when shared on social media. 

### NavPi Lite

Development of NavPi Lite is progressing with most of the framework needed to roll out the main send/receive/stake functionality. The login and API are secured by JWT token, the API is communicating to the NavCoin daemon and external APIs, and QR codes are rendering.

## Core Content Creators

Last week saw the Content Creators designing and writing supporting material and content for the Collab and NavCoin.org websites. They also set up the OpenAlias competition, and added to the bank of social posts in the buffer for release over the next seven days. The aim of gradually releasing social posts in this way is to ensure that there is a constant flow relevant information going out to the NavCoin community. 


That’s all for this week,

NavCoin Core
