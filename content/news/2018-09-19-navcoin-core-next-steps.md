### NavCoin collab forum

The NavCoin Collab Forum (aka NavCollab) will be launching soon. NavCollab is a supporting resource for the NavCoin Community Fund and is designed to help you in three ways:

1. You have a rough idea for a project, and want feedback to help you refine it.

2. You have a project, and need others to help you create it.

3. You’re looking to help an existing project that needs your skills.

Now that testing is complete the NavCoin Community Fund is almost ready to go too. Look out for details coming soon on the usual social channels.

### Education livestream #2

Last week the first in an occasional series of education sessions aimed at helping non-technical people learn more about the technical side of blockchain and cryptocurrencies was live-streamed on Youtube. It dealt with Cold Staking and how UTXO transactions work. The video will remain on this link so you can watch it at your leisure.

There were a few first-time technical difficulties, but they should all be ironed out going forward - thanks to a better internet connection and dedicated microphone.

The second education livestream is on Thursday 20 September at 0830 GMT +12. To help you get the time right, check the countdown timer on the Youtube link below.

This week’s topic is the benefit of using static block rewards to secure a Proof of Stake blockchain. Part of the session will be a live Q&A, which is a great opportunity to ask any questions you have about staking NavCoin. Make sure to save the date in your calendar and tune in on the NavCoin Youtube channel.

### Calling all ‘NavCoin Heroes’

The NavCoin community has a number high profile members who appear regularly on Discord, Reddit and Twitter. But there are many more of you out there who contribute a lot of time and energy to the NavCoin community - and that makes you a genuine NavCoin hero too. 

If you’re active in a crypto community where you live, and are keen to help share news and info about NavCoin in your social channels, Laura would love to hear from you. To get involved post in the ‘Community Action’ thread on Discord and tag ‘Laura’. Once you’re connected she’ll work with you to tailor content for you to share.

## Core content creators

It was business as usual for the Core Content Creators with the focus on developing and publishing supporting material for the Community Fund and Collab website. This includes content for the websites, PR articles and social media posts. 

With the revised page templates for the NavCoin.org website finalised, work continued for the roll-out of refreshed and additional content.

That’s all for this week,

NavCoin Core
