The NavCoin Community is a hive of activity this week with NEXT launching their lite wallet preview, the Bulletproofs Library being added to the ZeroCT PR, three articles published about NavCoin and a BTC/NAV pair being added on NovaExchange.

### NEXT Lite Wallet Preview Available

The NEXT Wallet developers have released the public alpha version of their lite wallet for NavCoin. NEXT first launched in June 2018 as an alternate interface for NavCoin Core. Since then NEXT has added support for multiple cryptocurrencies running as full nodes including LTC, DASH, PIVX and more. Updates have included advanced features for NavCoin such as community fund integration, news and a marketplace.

This latest release includes the capability to send and receive NavCoin without needing to download and validate gigabytes of blockchain data. After creating a wallet and securing it with a passphrase you can instantly start using NavCoin. The private keys never leave your device and signed transactions are sent to the broadcast server from the wallet which are unable to be tampered with in transit.

The lite wallet capability is still being tested by the development team, so if you want to check it out and participate in the public beta test then please download the latest version and join the navcoin discord server to give your feedback.

As with all pre-release software that is being publicly tested, be sensible with how much NAV you move there until a stable release is available.

For further information please see the [NEXT Lite Wallet (v1.1.3)](https://blog.navcommunity.net/2019/02/24/next-lite-wallet-update-v1-1-3-released/) release notes.

### Bulletproofs added to ZeroCT PR

Alex has been working to add the Bulletproofs Rangeproof Library to the ZeroCT implementation committed by Skreener. The [Bulletproofs Library is now committed](https://github.com/NAVCoin/navcoin-core/pull/412/commits/577761f02da267e9b97b78fd14282c916d15a807) to the PR along with some initial unit tests. This is the first step towards moving away from denomination based accumulators and including confidential transaction amounts into the ZeroCT implementation. Marcus and other community members have been helping to test the ZeroCT PR and continue to work with Alex towards finishing and stabilizing this new privacy protocol implementation.

Other progress on NavCoin Core has been made this week the NavCore Interns who continue to work on the Community Fund interface and Marcus who has been working on a range of GitHub issues and testing the existing Pull Requests.

### NavCoin listed on Nova Exchange

Community Members Juguelio and Chasethechaser working hard to get NavCoin listed on new exchanges over the last few weeks. This week a [BTC/NAV](https://novaexchange.com/market/BTC_NAV/) pair has been added to [NovaExchange](https://novaexchange.com) with more listings in the works.

### NavExplorer migrated to ElasticSearch

The API for the NavExplorer has been migrated to ElasticSearch and GoLang. This architecture change should provide a performance increase to the NavExplorer API by offering scalable, enterprise grade searching of NavExplorer’s data. The API has now been opened to the public and implementation details can be found on Prodpeak’s [NavExplorer GitHub repository](https://github.com/NavExplorer/navexplorer-api-go).

### NavDroid StakeBox Progress

Matt & Alex have continued work on the NavDroid StakeBox adding a notifications widget and service that can alert the user if the daemon is down, there’s an update available or other various warnings. They’re moving onto the wallet functionality after refactoring the Community Fund widgets and finishing the home page overview.
