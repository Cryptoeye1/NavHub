## Give your NavCoin address a name with OpenAlias

If there’s anything that clearly demonstrates NavCoin’s commitment to Simplifying Cryptocurrency for everybody it’s our latest initiative - NavCoin OpenAlias. Now instead of an impossible to remember long string of random characters you can give your NavCoin wallet a simple ‘email style’ alias.

Imagine how much simpler it will be to receive payments to your wallet when you can tell someone your address in a few seconds. It’s like the difference between having to remember a website’s IP address versus a .com URL. 

OpenAlias was originally developed by Monero, but NavCoin is the only other currency to make it available throughout its entire wallet ecosystem. NavCore Core, NavPay, NavPi and NavCoin Next all support OpenAlias.

NavCoin OpenAlias is a big step into the future of digital currency transactions, and you can join us in leading the way. Claim your alias now (be quick - duplicate alias aren’t allowed, so it’s first in, first served). 

If you’ve already upgraded to the latest NavCoin Core wallet, registering your OpenAlias only takes a moment. What will your alias be?
