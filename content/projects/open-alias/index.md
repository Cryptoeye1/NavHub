## Overview

OpenAlias seeks to provide a way to simplify aliasing amidst a rapidly shifting technology climate. Users are trying to cross the bridge to private and cryptographically secure infrastructure and systems, but many of them have just barely started remembering the email addresses of their friends and family.

For more information, visit [openalias.org](https://openalias.org/)

## Registering for an NavCoin Open Alias

First, visit [http://openalias.nav.community](http://openalias.nav.community).

### 1. Register your name

Register a name you like and the suffix `@NavCommunity` will be added automatically.

### 2. Copy message to console

A line of code will be generated to assign the address to the alias. Follow the instruction to copy and paste the code to the console in your NavCoin Wallet's Debug window.

### 3. Verify

The console in the Debug window will output a line of verification code. This code then needs to be copied back to the NavCoin OpenAlias to complete the verification process.

## Why use OpenAlias?

Open Alias was created by contributors to the [Monero](https://getmonero.org/) cryptocurrency project who wanted to find a way of simplifying cryptocurrency payments by bridging the knowledge gap between cryptographically secure systems and users who aren’t sophisticated developers.

1. **It's easy** - You can transform long alphanumeric codes in an easily memorable address.

2. **It's secure** - NavCoin Open Alias leverages DNSSEC to prevent MITM attacks on the alias.

3. **It saves time** - It’s quicker and easier to remember a meaningful OpenAlias address than a long string of randomised characters.
