summary: 'NavCoin is a decentralised network, and as such, itâ€™s only as strong as the people who make up the community. Anything that can help grow our community is a valuable use of time. Think outside the box! Find ways to connect with members of other projects in a positive & constructive way, without trying to tear others down.'
