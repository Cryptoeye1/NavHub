summary: 'Have a great idea for a series of articles? Writing articles is a great way to help people learn about NavCoin, and its ecosystem. Decide on whether youâ€™re writing for the NavCoin community, or for a wider crypto audience - and tailor your content to that. Popular places to publish content are on Medium, Steemit, and NavHub.'
