# Could you idea be the next big thing?

## Overview

{{< big_text >}}
Ideas can come from everywhere and from anyone. And they’re a great way to help inspire the rest of the community who might have the skills, but aren’t sure how they can be helping. It starts with ideas for products, articles, visuals, videos, tools, potential business integrations, marketing campaigns, and more. And then finding people who can help you bring it to life.
