summary: 'There are a lot of development projects going on in the NavCoin eco-system. Many of the developers of these projects are doing great work but need help to write articles that explain their projects and give progress updates. Check out the projects page and join the community on discord to see if you can help write about an ongoing NavCoin project.'
