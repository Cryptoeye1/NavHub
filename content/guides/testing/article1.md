summary: 'If youâ€™re familiar with programming, you can help with the creation of unit test. These are critical to NavCoin, and help speed up the workflow for new releases. Unit testing is the creation of automated tests that run to test specific functions. The aim is that when you make changes to any part of the code, you can see if it breaks any of the unit tests, which makes it much easier to ensure the software is doing what it should, and decreases the chance of any unexpected bugs.'
