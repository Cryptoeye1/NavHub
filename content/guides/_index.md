# Overview

{{< big_text >}}
NavHub is aiming to be a central resource for the community - by helping people find NavCoin community projects, share the latest news, and make it easy to get involved.

There are a lot of ways to get involved and ultimately maintaining this website is the responsibility of the whole NavCoin community. Here are a few suggestions of where to get started or you can browse to the specific guide on the left menu.

## Adding guides
There are a huge number of ways that people can help out, and creating guides makes it easy for people to do so. It can be daunting when first getting involved in an open source community, so making it clear for people how they can get involved lowers the barrier to get involved.

## Adding community assets
Community assets make it easier for other people to create new content. So instead of needing to spend time finding logos/assets/information - they can just get on with the job, and pull in the assets they need. One way to help the community is by making sure that any & all NavCoin assets are put in the community assets page through GitHub.

## Help projects write news/updates
There can be a lot of progress going on under the hood, and developers don’t always have the time to write about what they’re doing. A great way to add value to the community is to write about what’s going on, in way that’s easy to understand.


## Add in heroes from the community
Notice someone going the extra mile in Discord? Always available to lend a hand or answer a question across our channels? Add them in as a hero, and help them be recognised for their efforts.
