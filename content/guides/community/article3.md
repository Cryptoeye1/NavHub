summary: 'There are a number of different community projects being worked on, and the more people helping each other out the better. Download and use the software, try a few different tasks, and write down your feedback. Think about what makes you confused, which parts are broken, and what could be made easier. Some NavCoin projects are built in peoples spare time and published before they are completely polished, so user feedback will always be valued. '
