summary: 'Thereâ€™s no easier way to get to know your local NavCoin community than by putting on a meetup at a bar/restaurant/cafe. A great way to do this is to reach out to other members in your area and organise a time/day, and someone convenient for everyone. Planning ice breakers can go a long way to making everyone feel welcome, and feel free to take photos to share with the community!'
