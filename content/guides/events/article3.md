summary: 'The best ideas are developed together. By organising a whiteboard session or an online discussion, you can all focus on a specific goal/problem and develop ways to reach/fix it. This could be anything such as the future of NavCoin, ecosystem development, trading, technology, merchant adoption, advocacy, or a bug fixing session etc.'
