# How To Organize NavCoin Events

## Overview


{{< big_text >}}
Event are a great way to promote navcoin to the public and build stronger community connections in your area. Where you host it and how you promote your event will all depend on the type of event you are running. Once you know exactly what your event is, write a little description about it on the NavHub website and share it around our community channels.

## Types of event you can organize

  Always make sure to collaborate with your attendees - to make sure that you find a suitable time and location. If it helps, then setting up a mailing list, or some way to contact your local NavCoin community makes it easier anytime there is an event.

  When considering the location of the event, look for a comfortable, flexible space that can fit the number of participants you expect. Be creative - cafes, bars, community centers, co-working spaces, libraries and hacking spaces are great starting points. And ensure that the location is suitable and has what you require - whether it’s a certain size table, a whiteboard, or even just the right atmosphere.

  You won’t need a physical location at all if you are organizing an online event. But there are things to keep in mind - such as a reliable internet connection, clear sound, and good lighting in the room. As mentioned above, being a global community can make it tricky to arrange a time that suits a lot of people, but do try to take that into consideration. You also need think about creating a google hangout, or youtube live stream link for the community so that everyone knows where to go.

Help make it an enjoyable event by creating a welcoming, and creative space. Introduce people to each other, bring snacks/drinks, and plan some ways to get to know each other and how you all got into NavCoin.

{{< text_block
  title="Promote your event" >}}
Be sure to create an event on Meetup.com or Facebook so you can share links to invite others. Create an event card on NavHub and share your links on other our community channels will help make your event more visible. When you are hosting a location-based event you could send the event details around your local crypto community, as a way to target newcomers.

{{< text_block
  title="Budget" >}}
If you are hosting a bigger event like conferences or workshop, you might need some budget to make it happen. You need to list out the Guest speaker, book a space, and align the budget to your actual needs. Consider creating a proposal in the Community Fund to help out with the costs.
