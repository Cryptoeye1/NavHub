summary: 'Letting the community know about crypto conferences/meetups is the easiest way to connect with your fellow NavCoin enthusiasts - as well as getting to know the wider crypto community. Itâ€™s an opportunity to learn what others are doing well, and bring those experiences back to the NavCoin community. Adding these events to NavCoin lets others know that you will be attending, and creates an opportunity to meet up. As well as being able to talk to others about NavCoin!'
