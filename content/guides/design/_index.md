## Overview

{{< big_text >}}
Testing is a critical part of open source software - particularly in crypto where there is a financial incentive for people to try attack the network. Testing can help identify any bugs, and improve the overall user experience. And you don’t have to be a developer to help test NavCoin! Anyone can download the latest ‘release candidate wallet’ and give their feedback via GitHub.
