# NavCoin Design

## Overview

{{< big_text >}}
Design is a critical part of NavCoinâ€™s marketing efforts. As they say a picture is worth a thousand words. Visual content is much more easily shared on social media, and goes a lot further to cut through the noise. Great design attracts people, and can help educate new users on how NavCoin works.
