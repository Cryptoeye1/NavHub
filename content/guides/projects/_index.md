  Developers are a core part of the NavCoin community - we’re always looking for more people to help build new projects, and contribute to the wider NavCoin ecosystem.
  Whatever your skill set or experience, there are a range of projects you can help with. From fixing bugs, testing new releases, to creating your own project that uses NAV. In NavCoin, everyone gets decides what they work on.

  The NavCoin community fund can help you get paid for your contributions. All you need to do is submit a proposal, and the community votes on whether they think it adds to the NavCoin ecosystem. There is 500,000 NAV available in the fund each year for proposals, and it’s open to anyone.

## Create new Development project on NavHub

Once you’ve come up with an idea - you’ll want to add in a card on NavHub so that people know what you’re working on, and can offer to help out. All you need is a GitHub account, and you’re able to contribute to the website.

Once you’ve created your project, talk about it to the community! Let them know what you’re working on, why, and if you need any help. In our community we’ve got marketers, designers, copywriters, UX experts, developers, and people that are willing to be your first users.
