# Promote NavCoin

## Overview

{{< big_text >}}
Promotion is an important and tricky part of crypto. We want people to be able to find our content & learn about NavCoin, but it must be done in a way that doesn’t reflect badly on the community. If we’re reaching out to other communities/channels, it must be done in a way that gives value to those people.
