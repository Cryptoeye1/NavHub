NavCoin is a global digital community. It doesn’t matter where you come from - all that matters is the values that connect us together. And since we’re all in this together, let’s get to know each other!

Events can be added by anyone, and can be anything from video livestreams, to local meetups, or even general crypto events that NavCoin members will be attending.
